## [Unreleased]

### Phase 8 — Pi Tooling Recovery (fix/recover-pi-tooling)

#### Recovered and versioned Pi deployment tooling
- `pi.ps1` — Laptop-side PowerShell shortcuts for managing the deployed Pi
  via SSH. Dot-source into any session with `. .\pi.ps1`. Functions:
  `pi-ssh`, `pi-status`, `pi-logs`, `pi-logs-since [time]`, `pi-stop`,
  `pi-start`, `pi-restart`, `pi-run [seconds]`, `pi-config-check`,
  `pi-pull`, `pi-deploy`. Host is configurable via `$env:AVIS_PI_HOST`
  with a fallback to the LAN mDNS hostname `birdfeeder01@birdfeeder.local`
  — no hardcoded IP addresses in the repo.
- `scripts/install_service.sh` — one-command Pi systemd setup. Previously
  lived only on the Pi; now committed with executable bit preserved.
- `docs/PI_DEPLOYMENT.md` — consolidated Pi deployment guide covering
  first-time setup, laptop-side `pi.ps1` configuration, SSH key auth, the
  config override model, daily workflow, and troubleshooting entries for
  every issue we've hit during Phase 5–8 deployment (YAML corruption,
  audio device shift, Hailo errors, mDNS resolution).
- `docs/SETUP.md` — Pi Deployment section replaced with a pointer to
  `PI_DEPLOYMENT.md` plus a quick-reference for the daily deploy command
  and feeder crop tuning workflow. Removed stale `nano` instructions that
  referenced incorrect YAML keys.

#### Replaced `dev_config.sh` with Python-based override tool
- `scripts/dev_config.py` — new Python rewrite using `yaml.safe_load` /
  `yaml.safe_dump` to apply Pi-local config overrides by real key path.
  Declarative `PI_OVERRIDES` list at the top of the file is the only thing
  anyone needs to edit when overrides change. Backs up each config to
  `configs/*.yaml.bak` before modifying, validates all configs parse
  cleanly after application, and exits non-zero with a clear error message
  on any failure. Idempotent: safe to run multiple times.
- `scripts/dev_config.sh` — deleted. `pi-pull` now calls the Python script.
- `.gitignore` — added `configs/*.yaml.bak` rule so auto-generated backups
  never land in commits.

#### Bugs fixed (silent failures in the old `dev_config.sh`)
- `s/threshold: 0.70/threshold: 0.10/` never matched anything. The actual
  key is `confidence_threshold`, not `threshold`. Every `git pull` on the
  Pi had silently left the dispatch threshold at the committed default
  of 0.70 rather than the 0.10 we thought was being applied. Observation
  logs captured during this period reflect threshold 0.70, not 0.10.
- `s/enabled: false/enabled: true/` matched broadly. It only affected
  `hailo.enabled` because that was the only `enabled: false` in the file,
  but any future config block with the same pattern would have been
  silently flipped too. New tool targets the exact key path.
- Per-camera crop overrides (`feeder_crop_cam0`, `feeder_crop_cam1`) were
  not handled at all — the multi-line YAML block couldn't be managed with
  sed. They had to be manually uncommented after every `git pull`. Now
  baked in as structured override values.

#### Verification status
- Laptop-side: `dev_config.py` tested against committed `configs/*.yaml`
  — all seven overrides applied cleanly, backups written, configs still
  parse after application, `git checkout configs/` restores clean state.
- `pi.ps1` loads without errors, banner prints, `pi-status` verified
  end-to-end against deployed Pi (systemd `active (running)` confirmed,
  live log tail rendered correctly).
- Pi-side: `dev_config.py` hardware verification happens on first post-
  merge pull. Old `dev_config.sh` remains on the Pi until that point.

### Test count
- No new tests in this PR (tooling-only change). Existing 578 still pass.

---

### Phase 8 — Live Deployment Tuning (feat/per-camera-crop)

#### Per-camera crop override
- `src/vision/capture.py` — added `crop_x_cam1`, `crop_y_cam1`,
  `crop_width_cam1`, `crop_height_cam1` params to `__init__()` with
  `None` defaults falling back to shared crop values. `from_config()`
  reads optional `feeder_crop_cam0` and `feeder_crop_cam1` blocks from
  `hardware.yaml`, falling back to shared `feeder_crop` if absent.
  `_process_frame()` selects crop region by `camera_index` — cam0 uses
  primary crop, cam1 uses override crop.
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — added `feeder_crop_cam0` and
  `feeder_crop_cam1` optional override blocks with comments. Deployed
  values tuned during live calibration session 2026-04-19:
  cam0 x:630, cam1 x:420, y:130, 700×580.
- Backward compatible — existing deployments without per-camera keys
  use shared `feeder_crop` unchanged.

### Test count
- TBD — existing capture tests pass, new per-camera tests needed

---

### Phase 7 — Held-out Evaluation + Pi Autonomous Deployment (PR feat/phase7-evaluation)

#### Final evaluation on held-out test set
- `notebooks/phase7_evaluation.ipynb` — complete evaluation on data never
  touched during training, validation, or hyperparameter selection.
  Fixed KNN feature extraction (preprocess_file returns spectrograms not
  raw MFCCs — was producing 256-dim vectors instead of 80-dim), fixed SVM
  feature extraction (reads HOG params from bundle not hardcoded values),
  fixed experiments.csv append to 14-column schema.
- `notebooks/results/phase7/` — 7 evaluation artifacts:
  audio_birdnet_confusion_matrix.png, audio_birdnet_per_class_f1.png,
  visual_efficientnet_confusion_matrix.png, visual_efficientnet_per_class_f1.png,
  model_comparison_table.csv, ablation_dataset_size.png,
  fusion_weight_sensitivity.png
- `notebooks/results/experiments.csv` — 15 rows total, 5 new Phase 7
  held-out rows appended (KNN, BirdNET, SVM, EfficientNet, fused)
- `notebooks/audio_baseline.ipynb` — re-run to regenerate
  audio_knn_baseline.pkl, baseline evaluation artifacts frozen
- `notebooks/visual_baseline.ipynb` — re-run to regenerate
  visual_svm_baseline.pkl, baseline evaluation artifacts frozen

#### Results (held-out test set — unbiased final estimates)
- Audio KNN (MFCC mean+std):          macro F1 = 0.012  n=86
- Audio BirdNET pretrained:           macro F1 = 0.776  n=86   (67× KNN)
- Visual SVM (HOG + color hist):      macro F1 = 0.118  n=672
- Visual Frozen EfficientNet+LogReg:  macro F1 = 0.931  n=672  (7.9× SVM)
- Fused BirdNET+EfficientNet:         macro F1 = 0.945  coverage=96%
- Fusion weight sensitivity: optimal audio=0.05, F1=0.974
- Dataset size ablation: F1 flattens above 50% training data — pretrained
  features dominate, not dataset size

#### Pi autonomous deployment
- `scripts/avis.service` — installed to /etc/systemd/system/ on Pi
  sudo systemctl enable avis confirmed — starts automatically on every boot
  Hardware verified April 18 2026: active (running), Gemini calling,
  cameras open, detections firing within 10s of power-on
- `scripts/install_service.sh` — one-command Pi systemd setup script
- `pi.ps1` — PowerShell dot-source file for laptop Pi management.
  pi-ssh, pi-status, pi-logs, pi-stop, pi-start, pi-restart,
  pi-run (smoke test), pi-pull, pi-deploy

#### BaselineOptimizer stub
- `src/agent/baseline_optimizer.py` — AutoML agent stub, architecture
  fully documented. Targets OpenClaw framework for long-running agentic
  loops. Perceive→reason→act→memory over feature/hyperparameter search space.
  NotImplementedError on all public methods until Phase 8.
- `tests/agent/test_baseline_optimizer.py` — 3 tests covering stub behavior

### Test count
- 578 passing, 6 deselected (hardware), CI green

---

### Phase 6+ — Agentic LLM Layer (PR #42 feat/agentic-llm-layer)

#### Dual-agent architecture
- `src/agent/bird_analyst_agent.py` — BirdAnalystAgent: custom Gemini tool-calling agent
  via langchain-google-genai. advise() path called by orchestrator every 30min,
  answer() path for reactive user queries. Every cycle logged to analyst_decisions.jsonl.
  Graceful fallback: returns None when LLM unavailable, orchestrator falls back to
  fixed schedule.
- `src/agent/langchain_analyst.py` — LangChainAnalyst: LangGraph ReAct agent with
  3 memory layers (conversation buffer K=10, entity store, session tool cache).
  get_graph_diagram() returns Mermaid diagram of perceive→reason→act→memory state machine.
- `src/agent/tools/` — 14 shared tools (framework-agnostic):
  observation_tools.py (perceive), system_tools.py (perceive),
  action_tools.py (act), calibration_tools.py (self-tune).
  build_langchain_tools() adapter in langchain_tools.py injects runtime context.
- `src/agent/experiment_orchestrator.py` — ExperimentOrchestrator: autonomous Pi
  system controller. Boot notification, LLM advise() path, fixed-schedule fallback,
  daily .md/.json summary dispatch. Entry point for systemd boot via main().
- `src/notify/report_builder.py` — ReportBuilder: DailySummaryReport and
  ExperimentWindowReport from observations.jsonl. Outputs .md and .json.
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — added _push_text() for system-level plain-text push
- `src/data/schema.py` — detection_mode field on BirdObservation for A/B tracking
- `scripts/avis.service` — systemd unit for Pi boot autostart
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — orchestrator: and llm: config blocks added
- `requirements.txt` — langchain-core, langchain-google-genai, langgraph, langchain
  (google-generativeai removed — protobuf conflict with tensorflow-cpu)

#### Agent self-calibration
- Calibration tools close the autonomous loop: agent observes declining confidence,
  runs fusion weight sweep, applies better weights to thresholds.yaml autonomously.
  No human intervention required.

#### Hardware validation (Pi, April 17 2026)
- timeout 60 python -m src.agent.experiment_orchestrator confirmed:
  cameras open, Gemini called successfully, detection logged, autonomous feeder
  alert pushed ("Feeder activity dropped 96% over 3 days")
- LLM path: analyst=True | llm=True confirmed on Pi with gemini-2.5-flash

#### Notebooks
- notebooks/agent_demo.ipynb — presentation demo, USE_SYNTHETIC toggle,
  both agents running with live LLM, calibration charts, memory state visible
- notebooks/phase7_evaluation.ipynb — held-out test set evaluation scaffold

### Test count
- 575 passing, 6 deselected (hardware), CI green

---

### Phase 6 — YOLO detection pipeline (PR #40)

#### HailoDetector — YOLOv8s bird detection on HAILO8L
- `src/vision/hailo_detector.py` — new `HailoDetector` class wrapping
  YOLOv8s HEF (pre-installed at /usr/share/hailo-models/yolov8s_h8l.hef).
  Accepts full 1536×864 frames, resizes to 640×640 internally, decodes NMS
  output buffer, returns Detection(x1,y1,x2,y2,confidence,class_id) in
  original frame coordinates. NMS buffer: 80 classes × (4 + max_proposals × 20)
  bytes. Count field per class is float32 not uint32 — verified on hardware.
  PIL fallback for frame resize when cv2 unavailable (CI).
- `src/vision/capture.py` — adds detection_mode param ("fixed_crop"|"yolo")
  read from hardware.yaml hailo.detection_mode. Motion gate always uses
  fixed_crop for efficiency. In yolo mode: YOLO runs on full frame, falls back
  to fixed_crop if no bird detected. HailoDetector lazy loaded, closed in
  stop(). CaptureResult gains detection_mode and detection_box fields.
- `tests/vision/test_hailo_detector.py` — 35 unit tests (3 hardware
  deselected in CI), NMS buffer decoder tested with synthetic buffers
  matching exact Hailo YOLOv8 output format verified on Pi hardware.
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — detection_mode: fixed_crop (safe committed
  default), yolo_hef path, yolo score/proposal/confidence thresholds.
- `requirements.txt` — numpy pinned to 1.26.4 (numpy 2.x breaks
  torch.from_numpy on Python 3.11). opencv moved to requirements-pi.txt only.
- `requirements-pi.txt` — opencv-python==4.10.0.84 added for frame resizing.

#### Hardware validation (Pi, April 15 2026)
- YOLO running each cycle: "Camera 0: YOLO no bird — falling back to fixed_crop"
- Clean shutdown: "HailoDetector closed" confirmed, no segfault
- Notifications firing with image attachments confirmed

### Phase 6 — Shared Hailo VDevice (PR #41)

#### VDevice conflict fix — YOLO + EfficientNet both on NPU
- `src/vision/capture.py` — VisionCapture creates one shared VDevice eagerly
  in __init__ when detection_mode=yolo. Adds get_shared_vdevice() accessor.
  stop() releases shared VDevice after detector and cameras are closed.
- `src/vision/hailo_detector.py` — accepts optional shared_vdevice param.
  open() uses it instead of creating a new VDevice. close() only releases
  VDevice if it owns it.
- `src/vision/hailo_extractor.py` — accepts optional shared_vdevice param.
  open() uses it instead of creating its own. close() only releases if it
  owns it.
- `src/vision/classify.py` — VisualClassifier.__init__ and from_config()
  accept shared_vdevice param, passed to HailoVisualExtractor on first
  _load_hailo() call.
- `src/agent/bird_agent.py` — from_config() passes
  vision_capture.get_shared_vdevice() to VisualClassifier.from_config().

#### Hardware validation (Pi, April 15 2026)
- Both YOLO and EfficientNet confirmed running on NPU simultaneously
- Log confirmed: "Shared Hailo VDevice created (YOLO mode)"
- Log confirmed: "Visual predict: backend=hailo" on both cameras
- Log confirmed: "Shared Hailo VDevice released" on clean shutdown
- No HAILO_OUT_OF_PHYSICAL_DEVICES(74) errors

### Test count
- 443 passing, 0 failing, CI green

---

### Phase 6 — Hailo visual classifier wiring (PR #39)

#### VisualClassifier Hailo integration
- `src/vision/classify.py` — adds `hailo_enabled` and `hailo_hef_path` params
  to `__init__()`. `from_config()` reads `hailo.enabled` and
  `hailo.models.visual_hef` from `configs/hardware.yaml` automatically.
  New `_load_hailo()` method attempts to open `HailoVisualExtractor` on first
  `predict()` call when enabled, falling back silently to CPU PyTorch path if
  `hailo_platform` is unavailable or HEF is missing. `predict()` routes to
  Hailo or CPU — both paths produce identical `(1, 1280) float32` features
  for the sklearn LogReg head. `BirdAgent` and `ScoreFuser` are unaware of
  which backend is active.
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — fixes `hailo.models.visual_hef` path from
  `models/hailo/` to `models/visual/` (correct location of compiled HEF on
  Pi). Sets `hailo.enabled: false` as safe committed default — set `true`
  locally on Pi only, never committed (same pattern as `push: false`).

#### Hardware validation (Pi, April 15 2026)
- Full agent run confirmed with Hailo active: both cameras opened, audio
  capturing, Hailo HEF loaded and VDevice ready on first predict() call.
- Log confirmed: `Hailo inference active — HEF loaded from
  models/visual/efficientnet_b0_avis_v2.hef`
- Isolated inference test confirmed: backend=hailo, species prediction
  returned (WBNU), clean shutdown with no segfault.

#### Tests
- All 408 existing tests pass — Hailo path only activates when
  `hailo_enabled=True` and HEF exists, neither of which is true in
  the test environment.

### Test count
- 408 passing, 0 failing, CI green

---

### Phase 6 — Hailo HAILO8L hardware inference benchmark

#### Hailo EfficientNet-B0 compilation and deployment (this PR)
- `src/vision/hailo_extractor.py` — `HailoVisualExtractor` class wrapping
  HailoRT InferModel API. Accepts (224, 224, 3) uint8 frames, returns
  (1, 1280) float32 features for the existing sklearn LogReg head. Requires
  `HailoSchedulingAlgorithm.ROUND_ROBIN` for correct output from HailoRT 4.23.0.
  Falls back gracefully when `hailo_platform` unavailable (laptop/CI).
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — updated `hailo.models.visual_hef` to point to
  compiled `models/visual/efficientnet_b0_avis_v2.hef`.
- `scripts/benchmark_hailo.py` — reproducible latency benchmark: CPU 82.60ms,
  Hailo ResNet-50 raw 0.25ms (332×), Hailo EfficientNet-B0 13.04ms (6.3×).
- `scripts/compile_hailo_hef.py` — documents full compilation pipeline:
  ONNX export, calibration data export, DFC Docker steps, SE block avgpool
  shift delta fix, and Pi deployment instructions.
- `notebooks/hailo_benchmark.ipynb` — three-part benchmark narrative with
  live Pi results. Charts saved to `notebooks/results/`.
- `notebooks/results/experiments.csv` — 3 new Phase 6 rows appended.

#### Key technical findings
- EfficientNet-B0 compiled to HEF via Hailo DFC 3.32.0 in Docker (WSL2).
- HEF compiled for HailoRT 4.22.0 loads and runs correctly on 4.23.0
  (forward compatibility confirmed).
- SE block avgpool shift delta error resolved with model script:
  `pre_quantization_optimization(global_avgpool_reduction, division_factors=[7,7])`
- `ROUND_ROBIN` scheduling required — without it, HailoRT 4.23.0 returns
  `HAILO_STREAM_NOT_ACTIVATED(72)` and fills output buffer with zeros.

#### Tests
- `tests/vision/test_hailo_extractor.py` — 15 unit tests (mocked for CI),
  3 hardware integration tests marked `@pytest.mark.hardware`.

#### Hardware validation
- Benchmark confirmed on Pi (HAILO8L firmware 4.23.0):
  CPU baseline 82.60ms, Hailo EfficientNet-B0 13.04ms = 6.3× speedup.

### Test count
- 408 passing, 0 failing, CI green

---

### Phase 6 — Notification polish

#### Push image attachment (PR #36)
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — `_push()` now sends captured frame as multipart
  attachment when `push.attach_image` is true in `notify.yaml` and a valid
  image file is available on the observation. Selects best available frame
  (`image_path` then `image_path_2` fallback). Falls back to text-only
  silently if file is missing, too large, or unreadable. Audio-only
  detections include a note in the message body.
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — Add `_build_multipart()` module-level helper
  for multipart/form-data encoding. No external dependencies — uses stdlib
  `uuid`, `io`, `mimetypes` only.
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — Extend `__init__` with `push_attach_image`
  and `push_max_attachment_bytes` parameters. `from_config()` reads new
  `push:` block from `notify.yaml`.
- `configs/notify.yaml` — Add `push:` config block with `attach_image: true`
  and `max_attachment_bytes: 2500000`. Mirrors existing `webhook:` block.

#### Vision capture fix (PR #36)
- `src/vision/capture.py` — `_save_frame()` now saves the cropped frame
  (400×400px, 50–200KB) instead of the full-resolution frame (1536×864px,
  1–3MB). Keeps attachments well within Pushover's 2.5MB limit and
  represents exactly what the classifier saw.
- `src/vision/capture.py` — `output_dir` resolved to absolute path at
  construction time via `Path.resolve()`. `image_path` on every
  `CaptureResult` is now always absolute regardless of working directory.
  `raw_frame` preserved in memory for Phase 6 stereo estimation.

#### Tests
- `tests/notify/test_notifier.py` — Add `TestBuildMultipart` (8 tests) and
  `TestNotifierPushAttachment` (8 tests). Update `_make_notifier()` helper
  with `push_attach_image=False` default. Add 3 new `TestFromConfig` tests.
- `tests/vision/test_capture.py` — New file, 42 tests covering `__init__`,
  `from_config`, `_save_frame`, `_compute_motion`, `_update_background`,
  `_process_frame`, and `CaptureResult`. Zero hardware dependencies.

#### Hardware validation
- Pushover notifications confirmed delivered with attached cropped frame
  on Pi deployment. Three species detected during validation session:
  White-breasted Nuthatch (74%, 79%), Black Phoebe (99%).

### Test count
- 396 passing, 0 failing, CI green

---

### Changed
- `notebooks/results/phase5/` - moved phase5 result images into dedicated subfolder

---

- `scripts/audio_inference.py` — standalone BirdNET inference script for
  Python 3.11 subprocess bridge (PR #30)
- System validated live — fused detections confirmed:
  Black Phoebe 100%, Mourning Dove 90%, House Finch 92%, House Sparrow 79%
- Pending: camera physical mounting, feeder crop tuning, Hailo compilation

---

## [0.5.0] — Phase 5 Hardware Deployment (Software Complete)

### Added
- `src/audio/capture.py` — `AudioCapture`: Fifine USB mic (device index 1,
  48kHz native, no resampling), 3-second windows, RMS energy gate discards
  silent frames before BirdNET inference (PR #26)
- `src/vision/capture.py` — `VisionCapture`: dual Pi Camera Module 3 via
  picamera2, simultaneous capture, rolling background motion gate, feeder
  crop ROI applied before 224×224 downsampling, saves raw frames to
  `data/captures/images/` (PR #26)
- `src/vision/stereo.py` — `StereoEstimator` Phase 6 stub: full interface
  defined (calibrate, estimate, _rectify, _compute_disparity,
  _disparity_to_depth), all methods raise `NotImplementedError` until
  Phase 6 stereo calibration (PR #26)
- `configs/hardware.yaml` — Pi hardware constants: mic device index, sample
  rate, camera indices, capture resolution, feeder crop zone (x, y, w, h),
  stereo baseline, Hailo device address (PR #26)
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — `_push()` implemented via Pushover API (urllib,
  no SDK); credentials from `.env`; graceful degradation when credentials
  missing; `_webhook()` Phase 6 stub for future web app backend (PR #26)
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — `enable_webhook`, `webhook_url`,
  `webhook_timeout_seconds`, `webhook_auth_header` parameters and
  `notify.yaml` webhook config block (PR #26)
- Push notification confirmed working on device — House Finch, 87%
  confidence (PR #26)

### Changed
- `src/audio/classify.py` — `AudioClassifier` updated to BirdNET inference
  via birdnetlib (F1=0.776 vs F1=0.089 CNN from scratch). `predict()` now
  takes a WAV file path. Added `NoBirdDetectedError` for graceful degradation
  when no SD species detected (PR #26)
- `src/vision/classify.py` — `VisualClassifier` updated to frozen
  EfficientNet-B0 backbone + sklearn StandardScaler + LogisticRegression
  pipeline (F1=0.931 vs F1=0.097 fine-tuned). Added `camera_index` param
  passed through to `ClassificationResult` (PR #26)
- `src/agent/bird_agent.py` — `_cycle()` wired to live `AudioCapture` and
  `VisionCapture`. Both cameras classify independently. Cooldown suppression
  via `_is_on_cooldown()` prevents notification spam for repeat detections.
  `NoBirdDetectedError` handled as soft audio failure (PR #26)
- `src/data/schema.py` — `ClassificationResult` gains `camera_index` field.
  `BirdObservation` gains `visual_result_2`, `image_path_2`, `detection_box`,
  `estimated_depth_cm`, `estimated_size_cm`, `stereo_calibrated` — all
  optional with `None` defaults, fully backward compatible (PR #26)
- `src/fusion/combiner.py` — `fuse()` accepts optional `visual_result_2`.
  `_select_best_visual()` picks higher confidence or averages when both
  cameras agree on species (PR #26)
- `configs/notify.yaml` — added push/webhook channel toggles and webhook
  config block. `push: false` committed as safe default — set `true` on
  Pi deployment (PR #26)
- `configs/paths.yaml` — added Phase 5 model paths: `visual_frozen_extractor`,
  `visual_sklearn`, `stereo_calibration`, Hailo `.hef` paths (PR #26)

  removed accidentally tracked binary files (PR #26)
- `notebooks/visual_efficientnet.ipynb` — added cell 28: saves
  `frozen_extractor.pt` + `sklearn_pipeline.pkl` with verification round-trip
  (PR #26)
- `.env.example` — added `PUSHOVER_USER_KEY`, `PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN`,
  `WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` with setup instructions (PR #27)
- `docs/SETUP.md` — added Phase 5 model artifact generation section (PR #26)
- `docs/DATASETS.md` — added model artifacts table (PR #26)

  via birdnetlib 0.9.0; test accuracy=0.744, macro F1=0.776, weighted F1=0.823
  (18 species, n=86); 4x improvement over KNN baseline (PR #X)
- `notebooks/results/audio_birdnet_confusion_matrix.png`,
  `audio_birdnet_per_class_f1.png` — BirdNET evaluation plots

## [0.4.0] — Phase 4 Baseline CNN Models

### Added
- `notebooks/audio_birdnet.ipynb` — CNN from scratch on mel spectrograms;
  test accuracy=0.116, macro F1=0.089 (18 species, n=86); underperforms
  KNN baseline — insufficient data for CNN from scratch
- `notebooks/visual_efficientnet.ipynb` — EfficientNet-B0 fine-tuned;
  test accuracy=0.103, macro F1=0.097 (19 species, n=672); overfits on
  limited data
- `notebooks/results/experiments.csv` — cleaned 6-row canonical log with
  deduplication guard in all Phase 4 notebooks
- `notebooks/results/phase3/`, `phase4/` — result PNGs organized by phase

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` — added birdnetlib==0.9.0, tensorflow-cpu==2.21.0,
  resampy==0.4.3 under Phase 4 BirdNET inference section

---

## [0.3.2] — Phase 3 Fusion + Notify

### Added
- `src/fusion/combiner.py` — `ScoreFuser` fully implemented: equal, weighted,
  and max confidence fusion strategies; winner-takes-all species disagreement
  handling; graceful single-modality fallback; `from_config()` reads
  `configs/thresholds.yaml` (PR #18)
- `src/notify/notifier.py` — `Notifier` fully implemented: JSONL log channel
  appends to `logs/observations.jsonl`; print channel formats via
  `message_template`; `from_config()` reads `notify.yaml` + `paths.yaml`;
  push/email deferred to Phase 5 (PR #18)
- `tests/fusion/test_combiner.py` — expanded from 7 to 44 tests covering all
  strategies, disagreement resolution, single-modality fallback, and
  `from_config()` (PR #18)
- `tests/notify/test_notifier.py` — 30 new tests: init, log, print, dispatch,
  and `from_config()` (PR #18)

---

## [0.3.1] — Phase 3 Visual Baseline

### Added
- `notebooks/visual_baseline.ipynb` — SVM classifier on HOG + color histogram
  features (26340-dim vector); C selection on val set (best C=10.0);
  test accuracy=0.213, macro F1=0.121 (19 species, n=672) (PR #17)
- `notebooks/results/visual_baseline_*.png` — frozen C-selection, confusion
  matrix, and per-class F1 plots
- `notebooks/results/experiments.csv` — second row appended (SVM visual)

  label encoder saved for Phase 4 comparison (gitignored)

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` — added scikit-image==0.24.0 for HOG feature extraction

### Known results
- Top performer: DOWO F1=0.81 (distinctive black/white pattern)
- YRUM: high recall (0.78) but low precision — class imbalance artifact
- 12 species scored F1=0.00 — expected with HOG+color on limited data

---

## [0.3.0] — Phase 3 Audio Baseline

### Added
- `notebooks/audio_baseline.ipynb` — KNN classifier on MFCC features
  (80-dim mean+std vector, n_mfcc=40); k selection on val set (best k=3);
  test accuracy=0.302, macro F1=0.191 (18 species, n=86) (PR #16)
- `notebooks/results/audio_baseline_*.png` — frozen k-selection, confusion
  matrix, and per-class F1 plots
- `notebooks/results/experiments.csv` — running experiment log, first row
  appended (KNN audio)
- `models/baselines/audio_knn_baseline.pkl` — trained KNN + scaler +
  label encoder saved for Phase 4 comparison (gitignored)

  all notebook output artifacts

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` — added scikit-learn==1.8.0, matplotlib==3.10.8,
  pandas==3.0.2 under new Phase 3 section
- `.gitignore` — added `models/**/*.pkl` to exclude trained baseline artifacts

### Known results
- Top performers: OCWA F1=0.80, WCSP F1=0.63, HOFI F1=0.55
- Thin-data species (ANHU, BLPH, DOWO, MODO, YRUM): F1=0.00 — data
  limitation, not model failure

---

## [0.2.4] — Phase 2 Split Generation

### Added
- `src/data/splitter.py` — stratified 60/20/20 train/val/test split generator
  for both audio and visual modalities, `NABIRDS_CLASS_MAP` covering all 20
  SD species including plumage variants, deterministic via fixed seed
- `scripts/generate_splits.py` — CLI with `--audio-only`, `--visual-only`,
  `--train-ratio`, `--val-ratio` flags, reads all config from YAML
- `tests/data/test_splitter.py` — 32 synthetic tests, no real dataset files
  required (PR #12)

### Fixed
- `configs/thresholds.yaml` — added `splits` section (`train_ratio`,
  `val_ratio`, `random_seed`), fixed `audio_weight`/`visual_weight`
  indentation (were at root level, now correctly nested under `fusion`)

### Known issues
- CAVI (California Scrub-Jay) has no NABirds visual data — NABirds predates
  the 2016 AOU split of Western Scrub-Jay. Audio training unaffected.
  To be addressed in Phase 3.
